                Last devlog, I wrote about some things that inspired the design, game-play, and art in Diora.
                I would like to expand on that subject, and in the process, show some things that keep me inspired to make my projects.
                I have to constantly fight the urge to start new projects and forget to work on the ones I have had for years.
                Ironically, Diora was a procrastination project for a while, but in the end I believe it will be worth it.

                I do my best to not use ADHD as an excuse, so I try to work with it. 
                It may also be responsible for my active mind <del>and flawless social skills</del>.
                Anyway, music helps me focus on my work, shocker. I started making this Spotify playlist as I began to work on Diora, using it to imagine how Diora should feel, and what kind of music I wish I could use.
                You can listen to this playlist while you read this log, but make sure to lower your volume.
                Listen to it on Spotify if you can, these embeds are terrible.

            <p>Thank you Spotify for not having a volume slider on embeds or at least a way to set it with js, very cool. <code>&lt;/sarcasm&gt;</code></p>

                Here you can see a large collage of random pieces of media that inspired Diora in some way early in development.

            <p>Monument Valley</p>
            <p>
                Lets's be honest, Diora looks like Ida.
                I swear its because detailed designs looked messy when dithered.
                The design also has cemented itself, I'd feel bad if I changed it now.
                This chapter with the water also probably inspired the ocean house in Diora.

            <p>Captain Toad Treasure Tracker</p>
            <p>
                The first Captain Toad level in Super Mario 3D World looks like a Diora level, but it is basic.
                The actual Treasure Tracker games have much more interesting levels, with a cool diorama and miniature feel to it.
                These levels inspired the original vision of Diora with the worlds in jars.
                The name 'Diora' came from that original vision, representing the idea of dioramas you can explore.

            <p>ENA</p>
            <p>
                ENA is a fun, weird animation series made by Joel G. It even has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLurAhsqXWc" target="_blank">game</a> coming soon!
                I really enjoy the series, so ENA has heavily influenced the music and art of Diora.
                I especially enjoy music by Graham Kartna, Oliver Buckland, and Metaroom.
                Much of the music that inspires me for my projects is made by them.

            <p>
                When I first started making the 3D engine, I gathered some inspiration pictures for Diora.
                This is one of the best images on that collage, taken from Talking Points, a Jackbox Party Pack game.
                The pre-rendered background elements, blocky design, and abstract architecture was close to what I believed I could realistically achieve with 1-bit pre-rendered art.

                There are dozens of small specific references that I could share.
                I don't think people really need to see all of them, but they are there.
                You may notice them, feel free to ask about them or any questions about Diora!

                While developing Diora, I tried implementing many features for blocks and the 3D engine.
                They did't always work, but I learned a lot, and used that knowledge to make other successful features.
                I am not the first to express the "failing is okay" mentality, but it is good to keep in mind when developing on this kind of project.
                These examples have the failed idea on the left, and what it became on the right, including never before seen features!
                There are more than just these, but I have to save some until the trailers, right?

            <p>The code used for the cube outline was recycled and eventually became the code for the rope block! It uses real hyperbolic math so it is physically accurate!</p>

                While working on this log, I went back through my phone and found the actual oldest video of Diora, from the very first build I got working.
                This version didn't even have an editor yet, and couldn't handle more than around 10 blocks before dropping below 30 FPS.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thats it for this log, I hope that it was interesting. 
                The next log will most likely be about the 3D engine, so I think people will be looking forward to it.
