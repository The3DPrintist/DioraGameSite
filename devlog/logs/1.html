            <p>Hello World!</p>
            <p>
            During the 2023 Playdate Developer Lunch, Neven Mrgan told me I should make a devlog for Diora.
            I am finally ready, and I hope this will be interesting to devs as well as people interested in Diora.
            Since it is almost exactly a year since I started the project, I'd like to cover a brief history of Diora up to the present.

                In 2022 while working on Voyage (rip) and Pool, I had imagined a game that consisted of exploring small worlds contained within jars.
                This original idea has morphed over time into what Diora is now, but some aspects of it are still there.
                I imagined these worlds on a 3D grid made of blocks, where you can rotate the environment using the Playdate crank.
                The idea was inspired by many games I enjoyed, Including <i>Monument Valley</i> and <i>Toad's Treasure Tracker</i>.
                Some art and design aspects came from these games that I enjoyed.
                This idea stayed with me but I couldn't wrap my head around how it would be possible on the Playdate.
                I was content in thinking that it was impossible, or at least too resource intensive to run on Playdate hardware.

                I had my aha moment almost exactly a year ago, on 8/18/2022.
                I don't remember where I was when I had my aha moment but I was probably at my computer.
                When I did, I was quickly able to convince myself it would be possible to pull off, finally realizing how to handle the rendering and data.
                I was excited and spent 4 days programming the rendering logic and a rudimentary editor, and made my first post of Diora's engine.

                Diora uses pre-rendered blocks stored in large image tables, which are rendered using a list of blocks.
                This list is sorted by distance of each block to the camera.
                This means the blocks can be drawn in order of the list to avoid a depth buffer.
                The blocks are drawn at the correct point on screen, using a custom algorithm I made to be as fast as possible.
                Don't worry, I will cover the rendering engine in more detail in a future log.

                I was really excited that it worked, however, it barely ran at 30 FPS on the Playdate with around 20 blocks.
                I have spent a large amount of development time on optimizations, allowing for the game to run at a much better FPS with much higher block counts.
                Optimizations will also be expanded on in a future log.

                I have spent the last year working hard on Diora whenever I can, and I am making good progress.
                No release window to announce just yet, I am a full time college student and intern after all.
                I hope these are interesting, and thank you to everyone who supports me, It's great to be a part of this community, really.
