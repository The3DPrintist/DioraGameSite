            <p>Hello World!</p>
            <p>
            During the 2023 Playdate Developer Lunch, Neven Mrgan told me I should make a devlog for Diora.
            He was absolutely right, but I haven't really known how I wanted to, until now.
            So for this first log I'd like to cover a brief history of Diora up to the present.

                In 2022, while working on Voyage (rip) and Pool (not rip), I had an idea for essentially what Diora is.
                I imagined a game made on a 3d grid made of blocks, where you can rotate the environment using the Playdate crank.
                The idea was inspired by many games I enjoyed, such as <i>Monument Valley</i> and <i>Toad's Treasure Tracker</i>.
                These games can still be seen in some art and design aspects of the game.
            </p>
            <p>
                This idea floated around in my head for months, but I couldn't wrap my head around how it would be possible on the Playdate.
                The biggest roadblock would be correctly handling the rendering logic of blocks and keeping it optimized enough to run at 30 FPS.
            </p>

            <p>
                As all great ideas, It came to me at my computer.
                I had my eureka moment and spent most of the day convincing myself it would be possible to pull off.
                Slowly, I was able to comb through each issue that came up and create the first demo.

                This first demo, which I posted on twitter on 8/22/2022, was 2 days after started working on it.
                I will cover the rendering engine in more detail on one of the next devlogs, however, I will cover basics here.
                Diora uses pre-rendered blocks in image tables, rendered in order of the block objects, in a list.
                This list is sorted in order from farthest to closest to the camera.
                This means the blocks can be drawn in order of the list, allowing for convincing depth!
            </p>

            <p>
                I was really excited that my experiment worked, but it barely ran at 30 FPS on the Playdate with around 20 blocks.
                I have spent alot of development time on optimizations, which will also be expanded on in another post.

            I have spent the last few months working hard on Diora, and I am making good progress. No release window just yet.
            I am a full time college student and software intern after all!
            Anyway, I hope these aren't too boring, and thank you to everyone who supports me, It's great to be a part of this community, really.
