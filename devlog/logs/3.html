                I have been looking forward to this devlog, as many people have asked how I made Diora.
                The concepts that make the engine work are very cool and could be expanded to many other projects, so I hope that people find it interesting.
                Diora is a very integrated system, so I can't cover how everything works, but I will cover the basics.
                These steps are organized in the order of which I developed them, and will cover the steps I took updating the engine to how it is now.

                Diora started out as a single block floating in the void.
                Each block is a huge 180 frame Playdate image table.
                I create the block in Blender, render each 2° increment out to a folder of PNGs.

                Using some web tools, the images can be dithered and then combined into a line.
                This used to be done with third party tools, but eventually were remade from scratch for this website!
                I am hoping that the tools can be used by the community to make assets for custom levels.
                I am also planning to make a suite of tools and template assets that can be used for this purpose.

                Now that the asset has been created, it can be drawn to the screen, using bare-bones code that uses the crank to pick which frame to render.
                These blocks would use a lot of memory, luckily, the Playdate is the perfect console for this engine.
                Since Playdate assets are 1 bit, they are very space efficient compared to even a greyscale image.
                An image before building that is 3.25 Kilobytes, is just 217 Bytes after Building, thats 6.7% of the original!

                This is the part that took the most amount of time to get right, and there was a lot of math.
                I knew that I needed to offset the block drawing position based on the position and rotation of the camera.
                The normal way to calculate this position would require unique trig operations for every block, so I knew I needed a better way.
                To do this I decided to calculate the position based off a 0° camera angle, and then rotate that position around the origin.
                This formula has the extremely helpful benefit of only needing one sine and cosine value calculated for the entire frame!

                The formula needed to be tweaked to account for the size of the block in pixels for rise (29 px), and run (25 px).
                The screen y position can be multiplied by the constant (0.5771) to account for the camera angle, and there!
                The block can now be rendered in 3d space.
                The engine was never never tested with a different algorithm, but I imagine the efficiency of this method contributes to Diora's performance.

                Now that it can render in 3D, it can be expanded to draw multiple blocks using a table!
                Each block has an x, y, z, and r value that determines where it is in 3D.
                We can draw the block in order of the table, but when we rotate the camera, blocks will render out of order!

                Since we cant afford to use a depth buffer, we can sort the block table by their distance to the 'camera'.
                This is called the <i>Painter's algorithm</i>, named after how layers of paint stack on a canvas.
                The camera technically doesn't exist, but we pretend that it has a 3d position far away from the origin.
                Originally, I tried running <i>n</i> steps of a simple sorting algorithm each frame, since doing the full sort every frame was too much.
                This was the point where I made my first post of Diora, but it had room for improvement.
                This method left artifacts and was not efficient, so something needed to be done.

                You may have noticed in the example without sorting that it looked ok until the camera was turned past a certain point.
                Eventually I realized that between the 90° increments, no sorting needs to be done.
                By only sorting if the camera leaves that 90° zone, it sorts the table much less.
                With this method, the engine was finally able to run with an acceptable amount of blocks.
                This is paired with a binary search insert for moving blocks, such as the Player.
                The new method wasn't the only optimization, but it was the most impactful by far.
                There were many other ways that Diora has been optimized since then, and I'd like the cover them in a future devlog.

                It is starting to be a tradition for this section to be used to mention something I managed to completely forget in the last devlog.
            </p>
            <p>
                In that subject, I have started a habit of collecting print media from events in my life that mean a lot to me.
                These are usually unremarkable things from shows, conventions, and my internships.
                I even have the packing slip from when I received my Playdate!
            </p>
            <p>
                When I flew the to the 2023 Playdate Developer Lunch I only had a backpack with me, but I was able to get the check-in foamcore folded up into my backpack and brought home with me.
                I have it leaning up against the wall near my desk, and it is a nice reminder of how great that trip was.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thats is all for now,
                Thank you!
