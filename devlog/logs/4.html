                While working on Diora, I have spent a ton of development time <i>cranking</i> out as much performance as possible.
                Luckily, it seems like it is finally efficient enough to run at a good FPS!
            </p>
            <p>
                For this devlog I will be covering some general Lua optimization tips, then some Playdate optimization tips, and finally some Diorama Engine improvements.
                I imagine some of these are common knowledge, but they could greatly improve performance of a Playdate game!

            </h2>
            <p>
                Starting off with a relatively obvious tip, declaring locals outside of loops can be used as a slight optimization, since it doesn't need to be reallocated every loop.
                While this may be very subtle in most applications, this is extremely important in the drawgame() function in the Diorama Engine.
                There are currently 8 local variables that get allocated before the loop as nothing, and get set every loop.

                Make Local Copies of Globals
            </h2>
            <p>
                Diora has 13 other locals in the drawgame() function that are used to make local copies of global variables.
                This is also a subtle change that becomes very important in the engine, as finding a global variable is expensive.

            <p>
                In Lua, ipairs() is a convenient way to loop through a list.
                Unfortunately, the consensus is that it can be much less efficient then a simple loop.
                However, pairs() can still be useful, as it can be used to iterate through string indexed tables or sparse tables.

                Removing Functions
            </h2>
            <p>
                One of the most annoying improvements to the engine is replacing functions with copies of the code inside of them.
                The game currently has around 4 very similar blocks of code that all draw blocks to the screen.
                The purpose of this is to avoid calling extra functions during the draw loop, as every function call introduces unnecessary processing to handle the stack.
                While removing functions and replacing them with repeated blocks of code can improve performance, please use this sparingly, as it ruins readability and edibility.
                You may be able to use code macros to make updating the duplicate code easier though.

                Sprites VS Draw
            </h2>
            <p>
                In the SDK, there is a sprite system that handles the ordering and rendering of individual sprites.
                I initially assumed that creating the same static scene would show that using playdate.graphics.image:draw() would be faster, however it showed the opposite.
                I still personally have never used the sprites system for a game, and am unsure if it would help Diora.
                To support all of the features of the Diorama engine I believe that it would end up being slower due to ordering, setting position, and custom drawing functions that certain blocks support.
                For this reason, I generally would avoid using the sprite system unless your project follows the exact capabilities of the sprites.
                Or maybe im just close-minded, it was faster after all!

                Diora Optimization 1: Frustum Culling
            </h2>
            <p>
                Early in Diora development, I discovered that checking if the block was going to be on screen before drawing it would give a significant performance improvement.
                After testing, I have decided that this is because the process of drawing still takes significant processing even if no pixels will be changed.
                I believe this is mainly due to the code in the drawing function that calculates what range of pixels will need to be updated.
                Even if the range includes no pixels, calculating that rectangle is unnecessary.
                If your project has some limitation to where objects are drawn (in this case, only being above or below the screen), you can add a check before hand so save some performance.

                Diora Optimization 2: Distance Culling
            </h2>
            <p>
                The Frustum culling method helps with performance, but still requires the engine to calculate a screen position for the block.
                If there was a very cheap way to not process blocks that are known to be off screen, It would allow the game to have very large levels.
                To fix this, I developed a form of distance culling just on the Z axis.
                When a culling request is made, the engine starts from each end of the block list, and finds the index of the first and last block that are within a certain distance to camera's z position.
                The engine will only loop though this range of blocks, saving a huge amount of processing of offscreen blocks.
                This improvement was  very important and is the most recent optimization to the engine.
                Im glad that this worked, as all current levels comfortably run at 30 FPS!

                I hope that these are helpful, or at least interesting!
                I may update this list as more changes are made to the Engine for future optimizations.
